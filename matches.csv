Unfortunately, a malfunctioning valve wasted fuel and caused the spacecraft to miss its trajectory. The two necessary course corrections expended further fuel. In an attempt to save the play, it was decided to allow the spacecraft to remain in orbit around the sun for four years when a lower velocity trajectory would be avaliable. However, on 2002 April 21, powerful solar flares damaged the spacecraft's onboard communications and power systems. An electrical short then shut down the heaters causing the hydrazine fuel to freeze. When the spacecraft returned for another Earth swing-by on 2003 June 19, the fuel was thawed out.
